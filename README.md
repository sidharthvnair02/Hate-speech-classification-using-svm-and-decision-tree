Steps followed:
1. Load the dataset 
2. Perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) tasks
3. Clean the Data 
4. Split dataset to train-test 
5. Tokenize and make the document into a matrix 
6. Vectorize tweets for model building
7. Learn a vocabulary dictionary of all tokens in the raw documents
8. Transform documents to document-term matrix
9. Classify using support vector classifier/decision tree
10. Perform classification and prediction on samples in x_test


The accuracy of the model using svm is 94.91%
and the accuracy of the model using decision tree is 92.4%
